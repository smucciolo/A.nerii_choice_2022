Host selection of Aphis nerii and impact of host species on reproduction and behavior

Contact Info: Sophia Mucciolo, smm7660@psu.edu

These data and analyses are in the process of being published.

The goal of this study was to understand how A. nerii selects host species (milkweed) and how the aphids are impacted by their choice.

There were 3 separate experiments:
1. Greenhouse experiment testing aphid establishment and reproduction: cleanneriichoice.R, combined_nerii.csv
2. Y tubes testing aphid olfaction: neriiytube.R, ytubesFINAL.csv
3. Electropenetography (EPG) testing aphid feeding behavior: cleanNeriiEPG.R, neriiEPGcsv.csv
